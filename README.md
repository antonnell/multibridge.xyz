# Deploying your own cross-chain token 101

## Prerequisites

* Token & Logo data available on [coingecko.com](https://www.coingecko.com/en)

## Step 1: Fork AnyswapV4ERC20 and implement any additional functionality as required.

AnyswapV4ERC20 supports the following
* ERC2612 (Adds `permit`)
* ERC677 (Adds `approveAndCall` and `transferAndCall`)
* `transferWithPermit`
* Verify EIP712 and Verify `personalSign`
* AnyswapV4ERC20 needs to support `mint`, `burn`, `Swapin`, and `Swapout` to be compatible with multiple bridges.
* Multichain MPC address (detailed below) should be set via `initVault(address _vault)`

### Step 1.1: I already deployed my token

Deploy a wrapper for your token that supports `mint`, `burn`, `Swapin`, and `Swapout`, add this wrapper as a minter role in the ACL. In the wrapper add the MPC address (found below) as a minter

## Step 2: Deploy AnyswapV4ERC20 via AnyswapCREATE2

AnyswapCREATE2 is available on Ethereum, Fantom, Binance Smart Chain, xDAI, and Matic. More deployments to follow

Address: 0x54f5a04417e29ff5d7141a6d33cb286f50d5d50e

```
git clone https://github.com/connext/chaindata.git
npm install
-- edit deploy.js
node deploy.js
```

Edit lines 39 to 55

```
provider ~ choose from provider list for the chain
privateKey ~ address being used to deploy with
mpcAddress ~ address for MPC address on given chain
constructorArgs ~ token details (Token Name, Symbol, Decimals, Underlying token (optional))
verifyURL (optional) if you want to programmatically verify via etherscan/ftmscan/bscscan api
verifykey (optional) key to be used to verify via etherscan/ftmscan/bscscan
```

Deploy with the same code and salt to all the chains you wish to have your token on.

**NOTE** if you prefer to manually deploy, be sure to immediately call initVault(address _mpc) on the contract, as the default owner should be set to the deployer so the code matches on all deployments. Not even the constructor arguments should change on cross-chain deployments

## Step 3: Verify your contract on each individual chain (optional if deploy.js was not used)

Verify via;

* [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/)
* [Binance Smart Chain](https://bscscan.com/)
* [Fantom](https://ftmscan.com/)
* [xDAI](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai)
* [Polygon (Matic)](https://explorer-mainnet.maticvigil.com/)

## Step 4: Create a PR for your token into the token registry

Clone the connext/chaindata repo and submit a PR to chains.json with the following format;

```json

  "srcChainID": "1",
  "destChainID": "56",

}
```

If you are not sure on the chainID, you can confirm them on [chainid.network](https://chainid.network/chains.json)
Once the PR is accepted, the token will be merged and become available on [multichain.xyz](https://multichain.xyz/)
